        <h2 class="card-title">Love for all types of music</h2>
        <p class="card-description">
          According to Spotify, I listen to a wide range of music from latin
          styles to bollywood music. Within Latin music I listen to cumbia,
          reggaton, vallenato, latin songs from 40's to 90's, Andean music and
          much more. Also, I am into K-pop especially soundtracks from korean
          dramas. In addition, I listen to modern songs from Thailand and China.
          In all, I am curious about all the types of music out there and can't
          wait to add it to my playlist. For instance, I recently I found out
          Pop-opera exists and that Spotify is a need and not a luxury for me
          lol.

        <h2 class="card-title">Friends</h2>
        <p class="card-description">
          Despite wanting a large friend group, I seem to gravitate toward the
          smmall friendship groups. Most likely because I prefer quality
          friendships over quantity. That and I am introvert so the amount that
          I can socialize is more limited even with a a friend. Hence, why I
          went with the picture shown above. I prefer to hangout with friends
          and family in a small and intimate setting.

        <h2 class="card-title">Family</h2>
        <p class="card-description">
          I have a lot of family or should I say extended family members. Within
          my nuclear family, we are a family with 6 members. Each of us sibling
          have large age gap from 7 years and up. In addition, my family and I
          are close to other extended family members, but some drawbacks are
          they can meddle too much or be too gossipy but make for a joyous
          reunion during the holidays. As for me, I am in the processing of
          creating a family made out of circle of friends and close family
          members because throughout the years, I learned how important it is to
          have a support network.

        <h2 class="card-title">Software Enginerring</h2>
        <p class="card-description">
          I decided to sign up for Tripleten Software Enginerring bootcamp
          because of several reasons. One reason is that I always wanted to
          learn some hard text skills specfically Html, CSS and JavaScript.
          Therefore, when I saw that I would be spending time learning those
          skills and more; I just went for it. Another reason, is I want to
          transition into the tech industry. I am not ensure in what capapcity,
          but starting off from the software enginerring end and figuring it out
          from there. I must let you know that I am eternally always on the hunt
          to learn and do new things. In other words, education/learning is one
          of my values and I have studied alot of different things before
          undergoing triple ten software enginerring bootcamp, in my pursuit to
          figure out what I like and don't like.
